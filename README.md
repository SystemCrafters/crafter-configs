## Crafters

### David Wilson ([@daviwil](https://github.com/daviwil))

I've developed a whole system configuration based around Emacs, EXWM, and Guix which gets shared between multiple machines.  My configuration files are mostly stored in Org Mode files and exported with Org Babel.

- **Config Repo:** https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles
- **Operating System:** GNU Guix
- **Software:** Emacs, Guix, Vimb, Polybar, Dunst, mpv, GNU Stow
- **Keyboard:** Since I'm a ThinkPad fan, I use the [ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Compact-Keyboard-TrackPoint/dp/B00F3U4TQS/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1P0R7L5JJA8CG&dchild=1&keywords=thinkpad+usb+keyboard&qid=1604238423&sprefix=thinkpad+usb+keyboard%2Caps%2C-1&sr=8-3)

### Jens Schneider ([@jensac](https://github.com/JensAc))

My system configuration is based on Arch Linux, i3wm and rofi. The important config files are simply stored as plain text with some comments here and there. Feel free to copy, if you find something useful. 

- **Config Repo:** https://github.com/JensAc/dotfiles
- **Operating System:** Arch Linux
- **Software:** i3wm, i3status, Rofi, Emacs, Alacritty, Fish
- **Keyboard:** [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/). A masterpiece of hard- and software.
