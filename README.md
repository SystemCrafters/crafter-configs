## Crafters

### David Wilson ([@daviwil](https://github.com/daviwil))

I've developed a whole system configuration based around Emacs, EXWM, and Guix which gets shared between multiple machines.  My configuration files are mostly stored in Org Mode files and exported with Org Babel.

- **Config Repo:** https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles
- **Operating System:** GNU Guix
- **Software:** Emacs, Guix, Vimb, Polybar, Dunst, mpv, GNU Stow
- **Keyboard:** Since I'm a ThinkPad fan, I use the [ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Compact-Keyboard-TrackPoint/dp/B00F3U4TQS/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1P0R7L5JJA8CG&dchild=1&keywords=thinkpad+usb+keyboard&qid=1604238423&sprefix=thinkpad+usb+keyboard%2Caps%2C-1&sr=8-3)

### Jens Schneider ([@jensac](https://github.com/JensAc))

My system configuration is based on Arch Linux, i3wm and rofi. The important config files are simply stored as plain text with some comments here and there. Feel free to copy, if you find something useful. 

- **Config Repo:** https://github.com/JensAc/dotfiles
- **Operating System:** Arch Linux
- **Software:** i3wm, i3status, Rofi, Emacs, Alacritty, Fish
- **Keyboard:** [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/). A masterpiece of hard- and software. 

### Erik Lundstedt ([@erik.lundstedt](https://gitlab.com/Erik.Lundstedt))

I recreated window swalowing in awesomeWM for kitty and vivaldi webbrowser (wip)
awesomeWM needs you to move/symlink one of the files in awesome/settings/screens.lua* to awesome/custom/screens.lua as i use diferent settings on different devices with different screens(laptop is single screen and thinkpad has a bigger top-bar as it's a touch-screen)

- **Config Repo:** https://gitlab.com/Erik.Lundstedt/dotconfigfiles 
- **Operating System:** debian bullseye/sid
- **Software:** doom-emacs, awesomeWM, kitty, zsh with oh-my and powerline, and some others i dont use a lot
- **Keyboard:** swedish keyboard layout but I am not using the extra keys, I use alt-tab for some in-program things that might conflict when using a desktop enviroment as I bound super-tab to switch-window<<<<<<< patch-1

### Kavin ([@kavin25](https://github.com/kavin25))

My setup is a lot similar to the emacs from scratch playlist. I have added some stuff for my own comfort. It's all made in Org Mode and exported with Org Babel.

- **Config Repo:** https://github.com/kavin25/emacs_config
- **Operating System:** MacOS
- **Software:** Emacs
- **Keyboard:** Macbook Air 2017 default keyboard.
